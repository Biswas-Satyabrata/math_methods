Here you will get some mathematical methods implemented in python. You can use these codes and modify as you need. 
Methods are especially used in physics and math field.

I recommend you first learn about the method a little bit from internet or from a book then you will understand codes easily. 

Methods are :
Muller method
Curve surface area calculation
